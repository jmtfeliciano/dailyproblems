/* we want to convert a string into an integer. The strings simply represent the numbers in words.
"two hundred forty-six" => 246
"seven hundred eighty-three thousand nine hundred and nineteen" => 783919

Extra guidelines:  
- The minimum number is "zero" (inclusively)
- The maximum number, which must be supported is 1 million (inclusively)
- The "and" in e.g. "one hundred and twenty-four" is optional, in some cases it's present and in others it's not
- Assume all tested numbers are valid, you don't need to validate them
