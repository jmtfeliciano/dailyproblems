# Daily problems

Daily problems that I do and my solutions in Javascript

Problems may come from various textbooks, leetcode, and interesting questions from sites like reddit or quora.

## Some notable problems from the list and why?

- `queryToObject.js` because I had to use decodeURIComponent() 
- `pascalTriangle.js` because I used slice with negative number e.g. array.slice(-2).  Might be useful for getting specific number of values at the end in the future.
- `stripURL.js` because I had to use new Map() instead of using regular object.  Map retains order; regular objects do not.  
- `solomonDistanceGame.js` because instead of using if-else or switch, I utilized nested ternary operators.
- `highLow.js` because while it was an easy problem, I utilized .sort() with a callback and used ES6 string template literal
- `trackCharString.js` because I used regex and String.prototype.match() to track of desired characters
