Daily problems that I do and my solutions in Javascript

Problems may come from various textbooks, leetcode, and interesting questions from sites like reddit or quora.

## Some interesting problems and why?

- `queryToObject.js` because I had to use decodeURIComponent() 
- `pascalTriangle.js` because I used slice with negative number e.g. array.slice(-2).  Might be useful for getting specific number of values at the end in the future.
